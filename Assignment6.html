<p><center>The next steps of my project will entail a map of the amount of shares private corporations and the federal government have invested into these prisons. I am currently reviewing the investments of the Corrections Corporation of America (CoreCivic) and the GEO Group, Management & Training Corp., Community Education Centers, La Salle Southwest Corrections and Emerald Correctional Management; however, all of the data is on the stocks for private prisons. I will check Nasdaq.com or Yahoo Finance for additional data on Federal Prison Industries, also known as UNICOR and FPI, which is primary government sponsored and part of the Department Of Justice.</center></p>
